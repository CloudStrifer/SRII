# My Paper Title

This repository is the official implementation of [SRII: An Incremental Learning Apporoach for Sustainable Regional Isolation and Integration](https://*******). 


## Installation
***
To install requirements:

```requirements
python == 3.6
pytorch == 1.8.1
torch == 1.7.0
torchvision >= 0.8
numpy == 1.19.5
matplotlib == 3.3.4
opencv-python == 4.5.1.48
```

### Setup

 * Install anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
 * set up conda environmet w/ python 3.8, ex: `conda create --name <env_name> python=3.8.5`
 * `conda activate <env_name>`

```setup
conda activate <env_name>
conda env create -f environment.yml -p <anaconda>/envs/<env_name>
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to set up the environment, e.g. pip/conda/docker commands, download datasets, etc...

## Training
***
All commands should be run under the project root directory.

To train the model(s) in the paper, run this command:

```train
sh ./main.sh
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to train the models, with example commands on how to train the models in your paper, including the full training procedure and appropriate hyperparameters.

## Evaluation
***
To evaluate my model, run:

```eval
sh ./test.sh --model-file mymodel.pth --benchmark imagenet
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to evaluate the trained models on benchmarks reported in the paper, give commands that produce the results (section below).

## Pre-trained Models
***
You can download pretrained models here:

- [My awesome model](https://drive.google.com/mymodel.pth) trained on ImageNet. 

>ðŸ“‹  Give a link to where/how the pretrained models can be downloaded and how they were trained (if applicable).  Alternatively you can have an additional column in your results table with a link to the models.

## Results
***
Results are generated for various task sizes. See the main text for full details.
Our model achieves the following performance on :
