# My Paper Title

This repository is the official implementation of [SRII: An Incremental Learning Apporoach for Sustainable Region Isolation and Integration](https://*******). 


## Installation
***
To install requirements:

```requirements
python == 3.6
pytorch == 1.8.1
torch == 1.7.0
torchvision >= 0.8
numpy == 1.19.5
matplotlib == 3.3.4
opencv-python == 4.5.1.48
```

### Setup

 * Install anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
 * set up conda environmet w/ python 3.8, ex: `conda create --name <env_name> python=3.8.5`
 * `conda activate <env_name>`

```setup
conda activate <env_name>
conda env create -f environment.yml -p <anaconda>/envs/<env_name>
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to set up the environment, e.g. pip/conda/docker commands, download datasets, etc...

## Training

To train the model(s) in the paper, run this command:

```train
python train.py --input-data <path_to_data> --alpha 10 --beta 20
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to train the models, with example commands on how to train the models in your paper, including the full training procedure and appropriate hyperparameters.

## Evaluation

To evaluate my model on ImageNet, run:

```eval
python eval.py --model-file mymodel.pth --benchmark imagenet
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to evaluate the trained models on benchmarks reported in the paper, give commands that produce the results (section below).

## Pre-trained Models

You can download pretrained models here:

- [My awesome model](https://drive.google.com/mymodel.pth) trained on ImageNet using parameters x,y,z. 

>ðŸ“‹  Give a link to where/how the pretrained models can be downloaded and how they were trained (if applicable).  Alternatively you can have an additional column in your results table with a link to the models.

## Results

Our model achieves the following performance on :

### [Image Classification on ImageNet](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-imagenet)

| Model name         | Top 1 Accuracy  | Top 5 Accuracy |
| ------------------ |---------------- | -------------- |
| My awesome model   |     85%         |      95%       |

>ðŸ“‹  Include a table of results from your paper, and link back to the leaderboard for clarity and context. If your main result is a figure, include that figure and link to the command or notebook to reproduce it.
